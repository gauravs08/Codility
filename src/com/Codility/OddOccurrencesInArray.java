/*PROBLEM: A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. 
 * The array contains an odd number of elements, 
 * and each element of the array can be paired with 
 * another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.
For example, in array A such that:
A[0] = 9 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 9 A[3] = 3 A[4] = 9 A[5] = 7 A[6] = 9
•	the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,
•	the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,
•	the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,
•	the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.
Write a function:
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.
For example, given array A such that:
A[0] = 9 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 9 A[3] = 3 A[4] = 9 A[5] = 7 A[6] = 9
the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
•	N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
•	each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
•	all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.
